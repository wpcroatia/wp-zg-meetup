# Details

Hi everyone!

You must be wondering why is the description in English, again :D

The reason is that we'll have a non-Croatian speaker as a guest speaker at this meetup. So the meetup will be held in English this time.
We have two exciting topics for you, and as always, there will be prizes in the raffle.

We will add a meeting link in a few days and inform you about it.

See you all on March 25th at 06:00 p.m.

Registration is required (and free) via meetup.com.
